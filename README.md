# Shiny Apps

This repo contains my R Shiny app projects.

## Group Health Project

R Shiny app developed as a group project undertaken over 5 days as part of CodeClan coursework. Deliverables over that time were the R Shiny App, project documentation and final presentation.

The project brief was to create an app for Public Health Scotland, with the aim of improving public health in Scotland and reducing inequalities.

[The app](/group_health_project) delivers information on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Public Health Scotland's goal of achieving a Scotland where we eat well, have a healthy weight and are physically active.

Data were sourced from [statistics.gov.scot](https://statistics.gov.scot/home) and from [The Spatial Hub](https://data.spatialhub.scot/dataset/local_authority_boundaries-is).

I was responsible for initial app layout, data sourcing, geospatial and statistical analysis.
